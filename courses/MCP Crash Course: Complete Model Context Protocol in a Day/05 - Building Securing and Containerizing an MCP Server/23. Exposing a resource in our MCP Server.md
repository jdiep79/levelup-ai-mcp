**📘 Intro**

In this video, Eden (the real one 😄) demonstrates how to **expose a local file as a resource** in an MCP server. The example uses the `MCP README.md` file placed on the desktop. Once exposed, any MCP client (like Cloud Desktop) can access this resource dynamically — making it a powerful method to inject static context into your AI systems.

---

**📋 Summary**

You’ll learn how to:

- Copy and save a local file (in this case, `README.md`)
- Use the Python SDK to expose the file as a **resource**
- Test and validate the exposed resource inside **Cloud Desktop**
- Understand how `@mcp.resource` decorators work

**🛠️ Steps to Expose a File as a Resource**

### 1. **Save the README File Locally**

📁 Go to the [MCP Python SDK GitHub](https://github.com/mcptools/mcp-python-sdk)
📄 Copy the content of the `README.md`
🖥️ In Terminal:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
vim mcp_readme.md  # Or use any IDE
# Paste the content and save
```

---

### 2. **Prompt Cursor to Help You**

🧠 In `server.py`, prompt Cursor like:

```txt
Expose the MCP README.md file located in ~/Desktop as a resource using the Python SDK. Tag the MCP SDK docs.
```

📦 Cursor will generate:

```python
@mcp.resource(name="file/mcp_readme")
async def mcp_readme() -> str:
    """
    Exposes the MCP README.md from the desktop directory.
    Returns the file's contents as a string.
    """
    with open("/Users/your-username/Desktop/mcp_readme.md", "r") as file:
        return file.read()
```

✅ Accept the generated code.

### 3. **Explanation of the Code**

| Element                  | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@mcp.resource`          | Registers a new resource in your MCP server                     |
| `name="file/mcp_readme"` | Resource will appear under this name in Cloud/Desktop           |
| `async def mcp_readme()` | Returns the file content when the client requests this resource |
| `open(...)`              | Simple read of local file using Python’s built-in `open()`      |

> 📌 **Best Practice:** Ensure the description in the docstring is **clear and explicit** so MCP clients can reason when to use the resource.

---

### 4. **Restart Cloud Desktop**

♻️ Restart Cloud Desktop to pick up changes to the MCP server.

```bash
# Quit Cloud Desktop completely
# Reopen it normally
```

---

### 5. **Validate in Cloud Desktop**

🧪 In the UI:

1. Click the **"Cable icon"** (🔌) to view MCP integrations.
2. Find your server (e.g., `shell server`)
3. You should see `file/mcp_readme` listed under **resources**.
4. Click it to **preview** or **attach it to your prompt**.

**🧠 Key Concepts Recap**

| Concept              | Summary                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resources**        | Expose static (or dynamic) data to clients like Cursor or Cloud Desktop      |
| **`@mcp.resource`**  | Tells the SDK this function provides context on demand                       |
| **Resource Pathing** | Use `/file/...` convention for clarity in UIs                                |
| **Use Case**         | Perfect for docs, context files, configuration blueprints, static HTML, etc. |

**🔒 Security Tip**

📁 Be careful with what files you expose as resources — especially if the server is shared or public. Never expose:

- `.env` files
- Password logs
- Personal keys or tokens
- Anything with sensitive credentials

**🚀 What's Next**

You’ve now learned to:

- 📂 Serve static content dynamically
- 🔌 Connect AI tools to useful contextual anchors
- 🔍 Inspect and validate resources in real-time

This sets the stage for **resource-based agent workflows**, enabling smarter prompt grounding and retrieval-based tasks. 🎯
