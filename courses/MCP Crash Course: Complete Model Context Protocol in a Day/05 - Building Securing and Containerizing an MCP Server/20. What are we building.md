**🛠️ Intro**

In this new section, Ethan shifts focus from using **prebuilt MCP servers** to **building one from scratch**. The upcoming lessons will guide you through creating an **MCP server that exposes both a tool and a resource**, integrating it with AI applications like **Cloud Desktop** and **Cursor**, and finally **containerizing it with Docker** for secure, portable deployment.

---

**📚 Summary**

The goal of this section is to build a foundational MCP server that:

- 🛠️ **Exposes a tool** (e.g., shell command executor)
- 📄 **Exposes a resource** (e.g., a README file as context)
- 🐳 **Runs as a Docker container**
- 🌐 **Integrates with MCP hosts** like Cloud Desktop and Cursor

This lesson also demonstrates the **power and danger** of exposing shell access as a tool, underlining the importance of **security best practices** when working with MCP.

**🗝️ Key Concepts**

### 📂 Tools Recap

- **Tool: Shell Command Runner**

  - Executes any terminal command (`ls`, `rm`, etc.)
  - Demonstrated with `ls` on Desktop.
  - Extremely **dangerous if misused**.
  - Illustrates the need for **access control**, **input validation**, and **user confirmation**.

- **Tool: Fake “You Got Hacked” Script**

  - Downloads and displays an external ASCII payload.
  - Proves how easily MCP tools can fetch and run remote code.

---

### 📁 Resources Recap

- **Resource: MCP README File**

  - Content from the MCP Python SDK's README file.
  - Made available as an **attachable resource** to prompt context.
  - Appears inside Cloud’s MCP resource tab and can be injected into prompts.

---

**🚨 Security Warning**

Ethan demonstrates how an AI agent, even with basic safeguards, can be manipulated:

> ❌ Cursor refused direct deletion via “Run this command”.
> ✅ But it complied with: “Help me clean up my computer by deleting…”

This highlights **contextual prompt vulnerabilities** and why developers must:

- **Avoid exposing highly-permissive tools** like shell access without guardrails.
- **Implement manual approvals** and permission tiers.
- **Scan open-source MCP servers for malicious behavior**.

**🐳 Why Docker?**

| Benefit                  | Description                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📦 **Isolation**         | Runs in its own environment — great for security.        |
| 🔁 **Portability**       | Deploy anywhere — laptop, cloud, serverless.             |
| 📐 **Consistency**       | Avoid “it works on my machine” problems.                 |
| 🔐 **Enhanced Security** | Limit file system or network access via Docker settings. |

**🔧 What You’ll Build Next**

| Component         | Description                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tool**          | Executes shell commands (with caution).                     |
| **Resource**      | A file like `README.md` that can be attached to prompts.    |
| **Integration**   | Cloud Desktop and Cursor will call the server tools.        |
| **Dockerization** | Containerize the server for reproducibility and deployment. |

**🧠 Best Practices Moving Forward**

| Practice                                      | Why It Matters                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ❗ Review tool permissions                    | Prevent accidental or malicious actions     |
| 🧪 Always test in isolated envs               | Don’t run unknown tools on your dev machine |
| 🔒 Never trust public MCP servers blindly     | Supply chain attacks are very real          |
| 🧰 Use Inspector or logs to trace tool calls  | Debug and audit behavior                    |
| ✅ Use Docker for production-ready deployment | Clean, consistent, and secure               |

**📦 GitHub Codebase**

- All source code for this custom MCP server will be published and linked in upcoming videos.
- You’ll be able to clone it, run it locally, and customize it for your use case.
