Here's a full Markdown summary of Eden’s video about integrating the Dockerized MCP server with **Cloud Desktop**, with a strong focus on 🐳 Docker command customization, error handling, and how to ensure proper connectivity between MCP client and server:

## 🧩 Integrating a Dockerized MCP Server with Cloud Desktop

### 🐳 **Context**

Before Docker, we ran the MCP server using:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

Now, after containerizing, we need to **instruct Cloud Desktop** to run the MCP server through Docker instead of a local script. That means configuring the JSON file to **launch the Docker container** properly.

---

### 🧱 **Incorrect Setup**

Eden first attempted:

```json
{
  "command": "docker",
  "args": ["run", "-it", "shell-server-app"]
}
```

> ❌ But Cloud Desktop failed to connect, and the logs weren’t helpful at first glance. The container didn’t behave correctly — likely due to stdin/stdout issues.

---

### 🛠️ **Fix Strategy**

#### 1. **Research and Compare**

Eden reviewed the [official MCP Docker tutorial](https://github.com) and noticed these **important flags and env vars** were used:

```bash
docker run \
  -i \
  --rm \
  --init \
  -e DOCKER_CONTAINER=true \
  shell-server-app
```

#### 2. **Flag Explanations**

| Flag                       | Purpose                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-i`                       | Keeps STDIN open — critical for MCP’s communication with the client              |
| `--rm`                     | Auto-removes the container when it exits                                         |
| `--init`                   | Handles child process reaping, avoids zombie processes                           |
| `-e DOCKER_CONTAINER=true` | Tells MCP it's running in a Docker container — the SDK might use this internally |

> ⚠️ Eden initially used `-it`, which combines `-i` and `-t`. But the `-t` allocates a pseudo-terminal, which **can interfere** with MCP’s stdio-based communication.

---

### ⚙️ **Final Working Command**

Here's the updated JSON configuration for Cloud Desktop:

```json
{
  "docker-shell": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "-i",
      "--rm",
      "--init",
      "-e",
      "DOCKER_CONTAINER=true",
      "shell-server-app"
    ]
  }
}
```

Make sure this block is placed **inside** the `"servers"` object in your MCP config file (not above it!).

---

### 🧪 **Validation**

After restarting Cloud Desktop:

- ✅ The Docker-based MCP server was recognized
- ✅ Tools like `run-command` became available again
- ✅ Output worked as expected, confirming communication via stdio was functional

---

### 🧠 **Takeaways**

- MCP **requires stdio access**; don’t use `-t` unless you're sure it's safe
- Set `DOCKER_CONTAINER=true` to ensure internal compatibility
- Always place new MCP server definitions inside the correct section of your config
- Logs are your friend — but also cross-check with official examples when in doubt

---

Let me know if you'd like a `docker-compose.yml` version of this setup or a prebuilt MCP + Cloud Desktop config.
