**🧠 Intro**

In this hands-on tutorial, Ethan walks through building an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server from scratch** using the Python SDK. The server exposes a **shell tool** that can run terminal commands on the host machine. By the end of the session, the server is fully integrated with **Cloud Desktop**, enabling live execution of terminal commands directly from the AI interface.

---

**📦 Summary**

You’ll learn how to:

- Build an MCP server using the Python SDK
- Expose a `run_command` tool to execute terminal commands
- Use `asyncio` and `subprocess` for non-blocking execution
- Fix common integration issues with Cloud Desktop
- Safely test your tool in a local dev environment

---

**🔧 Implementation Steps**

### 1. **Generate Code with Cursor**

Open `server.py` in **Cursor**, use the following prompt:

```txt
Implement a simple MCP server using the MCP Python SDK. The server should expose a tool called `terminal` that lets the user run terminal commands.
```

Cursor will generate:

- `server.py` with `run_command` coroutine
- `README.md` with usage instructions

---

### 2. **Review of Key Code Parts**

#### 🛠️ Server Initialization

```python
from mcp_server.fast_mcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="Terminal Server")
```

#### ⚙️ Tool: Run Command

```python
@mcp.tool(
    name="run_command",
    description="Run a terminal command and return the output.",
    args_schema={"command": "str"},
    returns={"stdout": "str", "stderr": "str", "returncode": "int"},
)
async def run_command(command: str) -> dict:
    process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(
        command,
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE
    )
    stdout, stderr = await process.communicate()
    return {
        "stdout": stdout.decode(),
        "stderr": stderr.decode(),
        "returncode": process.returncode
    }
```

#### 🧨 Fix: Wrong Serve Method

Cursor generated:

```python
await mcp.serve()
```

✅ Correct it to:

```python
mcp.run()
```

And set transport:

```python
mcp.run(transport="stdio")
```

---

### 3. **Run the Server Locally**

```bash
uv run server.py
```

Ensure your terminal is inside the virtual environment (it should show the environment name).

---

### 4. **Cloud Desktop Integration**

#### 🗂️ Update MCP Config

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "shell": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "/absolute/path/to/shell-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

⚠️ _Important:_ Make sure this config is placed **inside** the `"mcp_servers"` dictionary block.

#### ♻️ Restart Cloud Desktop

After updating the config, quit and reopen Cloud Desktop to reload MCP settings.

---

**🧪 Testing the Tool**

1. Ask Cloud:

   ```
   Show me the directories on my Desktop
   ```

2. Cloud detects your `run_command` tool and proposes to use:

   ```
   ls -la ~/Desktop
   ```

3. Output appears in `stdout`, and Cloud generates a grounded, real-time response.

4. Verify the result matches your actual desktop contents ✅

| Feature                           | Explanation                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FastMCP`                         | Main class to define and run the MCP server                    |
| `@mcp.tool`                       | Decorator that exposes a function as an MCP tool               |
| `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell` | Executes the command asynchronously                            |
| `transport="stdio"`               | Communication layer between MCP server and client              |
| MCP Config                        | Links Cloud Desktop to your server with correct command & path |
| Cursor Indexing                   | Makes sure auto-generated code is accurate & informed          |

**⚠️ Security Note**

Running terminal commands via MCP tools is **very powerful**—and dangerous. Always:

- Limit access
- Sanitize input
- Avoid exposing tools with write/delete capability unless absolutely necessary
- Audit any open-source MCP tools before using them

**🚀 What’s Next**

In the following sessions:

- Expose a **resource** (e.g., a static README file)
- Add **Docker support** to containerize and deploy your server
- Learn about **security best practices** and **permission handling**

You’ve now got a fully functional custom MCP server that bridges the gap between AI and your operating system! 🧠💻✨
