## 🐳 Dockerizing Your MCP Server (with Cursor's Help)

### 🎯 **Intro**

In this video, Eden walks through how to take an existing MCP server (previously built in Python using the `uv` package manager) and containerize it using Docker. The goal: ensure cross-platform portability, reproducibility, and prepare the server for deployment anywhere — even in the cloud.

---

### 🧭 **Summary**

You'll learn how to:

- Write a `Dockerfile` using `uv` to manage your Python environment
- Build and run a Docker image for your MCP server
- Understand Docker caching strategies
- Avoid common pitfalls when building images (like forgetting the lock file)
- Integrate this containerized server into Cloud Desktop

---

### 🔑 **Key Concepts & Steps**

#### 1. ✍️ Write a Dockerfile

Cursor helped generate a `Dockerfile` using:

- **Base image**: `python:3.12-slim-bookworm`
- **Package manager**: `uv`, installed into `/usr/local/bin`
- **Working directory**: `/app`

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

RUN curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
WORKDIR /app
COPY pyproject.toml ./
COPY uv.lock ./

RUN uv sync --frozen --no-install-project

COPY server.py ./
RUN uv sync --frozen

CMD ["uv", "run", "server.py"]
```

> ⚠️ Bug Fix: Initially forgot to copy `uv.lock`, causing the build to fail. Added `COPY uv.lock ./` to fix it.

---

#### 2. 🏗 Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t shell-server-app .
```

- `-t`: Tags the image with a name (`shell-server-app`)
- `.`: Uses the current directory (must contain the `Dockerfile`)

> 🐛 Caught and fixed a build error due to missing `uv.lock`.

---

#### 3. 🧪 Test the Docker Image

```bash
docker run -it --rm shell-server-app
```

- `-it`: Interactive terminal
- `--rm`: Automatically removes the container after exit

> ✨ Tip: Run `docker ps` to verify it's running and `docker logs <container_id>` to inspect logs.

---

### 💡 Optimization Tip

Two separate `RUN uv sync` calls:

- First for dependencies only (cached on rebuilds)
- Second for project code (which changes frequently)

This **Docker caching strategy** reduces rebuild time and prevents dependency reinstallation on every code change.

---

### 🔐 Security Awareness

> ⚠️ Be careful with base images from untrusted sources.

- Malicious base images can compromise your container
- Always verify official images (e.g. `python:3.12-slim-bookworm`)

---

### 📦 Integration with Cloud Desktop

After verifying the Docker container runs, the next step (as hinted in the outro) is to **configure Cloud Desktop to use the containerized MCP server** as a resource.

---

### ✅ In Summary

**Why Dockerize Your MCP Server?**

- 🔁 Portability across dev/stage/prod
- 🧼 Isolation from host system
- 🔒 Controlled access (volumes/devices)
- 🚀 Ready for cloud deployment (Kubernetes, ECS, etc.)

**What You Learned:**

- How to create a Dockerfile tailored for `uv` and Python
- Build/debug the Docker image lifecycle
- Integration patterns with AI tooling like Cloud Desktop
