**🛡️ MCP & Security: Remote Code Execution and Supply Chain Attacks**

This lesson focuses on **security implications** of using **MCP servers**, highlighting the risks of **remote code execution (RCE)** and **supply chain attacks** through a hands-on, eye-opening demonstration.

---

### 📘 Summary

You’ll learn:

- How exposing an **MCP tool** that downloads remote content can become a security risk.
- Why blindly trusting public MCP servers is **dangerous**.
- How even "benign" tools can be **weaponized**.
- The basics of **supply chain attacks** in the context of MCP.

### ⚙️ Steps from the Video

#### 1. **Create a Public “Malicious” File**

🌐 Go to [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
📝 Create a public file named `hacked.txt`
🔫 Paste some ASCII art that humorously shows "you got hacked"

#### 2. **Expose a New MCP Tool**

🧠 Prompt Cursor:

> Expose another tool in my MCP server using Python SDK. The tool should be called `benign_tool` and download the text file from this \[GitHub Gist URL] using `curl`. Return the downloaded content.

🧾 Example Tool Code:

```python
@mcp.tool("benign_tool")
async def benign_tool() -> dict:
    """
    Downloads content from a remote URL using curl.
    """
    url = "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/..."
    process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(
        f"curl {url}",
        stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE
    )
    stdout, stderr = await process.communicate()
    return {
        "output": stdout.decode(),
        "status": process.returncode
    }
```

✅ Accept the code and restart Cloud Desktop.

---

### 🧪 Execution

1. Open Cloud Desktop
2. Prompt: “Run the benign tool”
3. ✅ Allow execution
4. 📥 The server downloads and displays the ASCII "you got hacked" message.

### ⚠️ Key Security Lessons

#### 🚨 1. **Remote Code Execution Risk**

Even if the payload was harmless ASCII art, **any code or script** could’ve been downloaded and executed, such as:

- 🕵️ Credential stealers
- 💣 Hard drive wipers
- 💻 Reverse shells

#### 🔗 2. **MCP = Remote Code Execution**

> By design, **MCP servers run code from other sources**, making every tool a potential RCE vector.

Using an MCP server you didn’t write = running someone else's code on your machine!

#### 🔒 3. **Supply Chain Attacks**

Even if you trust an official MCP repo (e.g., from Cloudflare), it might:

- Depend on a vulnerable open-source package
- Be altered via third-party pull requests
- Contain subtle backdoors from upstream dependencies

#### 🔬 4. **Hidden Payloads**

A seemingly innocent URL (e.g. `https://gist.github.com/user/hacked.txt`) could:

- Change content post-audit
- Serve different payloads to different user agents
- Use obfuscated or base64-encoded scripts

### 🧠 Best Practices

| ✅ Do                             | ❌ Don’t                                     |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Audit all MCP server code you use | Blindly trust open-source MCP servers        |
| Use static typing and logging     | Allow unrestricted shell tool access         |
| Pin dependency versions           | Leave secrets exposed in code                |
| Isolate MCP servers in Docker     | Expose tools without strict input validation |

---

### 🧯 Defense Tips

- Use **read-only** environments or containers
- Explicitly whitelist safe commands in shell tools
- Require tool invocation approval (as seen in Cloud Desktop)
- Scan open-source dependencies using tools like `npm audit`, `pyright`, `semgrep`
- Never hardcode URLs without verifying their content and origin

### 🧩 Final Thoughts

This demo illustrated that **MCP servers are incredibly powerful**, but with great power comes:

- Great **risk** ⚠️
- Need for **security hygiene** 🧼
- Importance of **code review** 🔍

**Treat every MCP server as potential RCE.** Whether it’s from GitHub or even an official vendor — **trust, but verify**. 🔐
