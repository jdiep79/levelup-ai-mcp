## 🐳 Dockerized MCP Server: Cloud Integration, Logs, & Verification

This video walks through the **final integration** of the Dockerized MCP server with Cloud Desktop. Eden demonstrates launching, observing logs, and validating tool behavior inside the container environment.

---

### 🧰 MCP Server Verification in Docker

#### ✅ Confirming Docker-Based Server in Cloud

- Cloud Desktop is restarted and now correctly recognizes the Dockerized server as:

  ```
  Server: docker-shell
  Tool: run-command
  ```

- Verified via **Settings > Developer** — shows Docker CLI arguments exactly as defined in the JSON config.

---

### 📜 Docker Containers & Logs

#### 🐳 Listing Containers

```bash
docker ps
```

Showed two running containers — likely from earlier experiments.

#### 🧾 Checking Logs

```bash
docker logs --follow <container-id>
```

- Older container only had tool initialization logs.
- Newer container had full output, including:

  - Ascii art generation for `"hello MCP"` via `echo`
  - Command output: `stdout`, status `0`

---

### 🧪 Tool Demonstration: ASCII Art & File Echo

#### Example Input:

> “Write cool with better ASCII art and echo it.”

#### Behind-the-Scenes:

- MCP created a file `cool.txt`
- Wrote ASCII content to it
- Ran `cat cool.txt` to display

#### Container Output:

- Captured in logs and rendered correctly in Cloud

---

### 🗂️ Filesystem Test: Desktop Listing

#### Command:

```bash
ls -la ~/Desktop
```

#### Result:

- **Error** — Desktop folder not found
- MCP fallback:

  1. Tried listing `~/` — no Desktop present
  2. Listed `./` — found project files:

     - `cool.txt`, `hello.txt`
     - `server.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`

> ✅ This confirmed **Docker isolation** — no host files are visible unless mounted.

---

### 🧨 Dangerous Tool Test: File Deletion

#### In-Container Shell:

```bash
docker exec -it <container-id> sh
ls          # Shows files
```

#### Deletion Request:

```plaintext
“Please remove hello.txt from the container”
```

✅ Cloud complied via `rm -f hello.txt`

#### Validation:

- File gone in both MCP log and direct container inspection.

---

### 📤 GitHub Sync

- Docker setup committed to GitHub.
- Commit message auto-generated via Cursor AI.
- Repository now contains:

  - `Dockerfile`
  - `server.py`
  - `cool.txt` + other project files

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings

🔐 **Isolation Observed**

- Container had no access to host’s Desktop.
- Prevented accidental data exposure.

🛡️ **Safe Testing Zone**

- Used terminal command tool to validate sandbox behavior.

📦 **Dynamic Container Interaction**

- Tools invoked from Cloud Desktop executed inside a real Docker container.

🔁 **Live Log Tailing**

- `docker logs --follow` gave real-time feedback from the MCP server.

💡 **Confirmation via Dual Methods**

- Cross-validation using both Cloud Desktop and direct `docker exec` shell.
