## 🔐 MCP Server OAuth2 Flow in Action: Live Test and Deep Dive

In this video, Eden walks us through the **live testing** of the Remote MCP Server’s OAuth 2.0 flow using the **MCP Inspector tool**, showing how all components communicate during secure authorization and tool access.

### 🧱 System Overview Recap

| Component                | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **ToDos API**         | Protected API to fetch todos (requires JWT token with proper scopes)    |
| ✅ **Remote MCP Server** | OAuth2 authorization server + exposes tools to fetch data from API      |
| ✅ **Auth0**             | Identity provider; issues access tokens via OAuth2                      |
| ✅ **MCP Inspector**     | OAuth client (CLI app); attempts to use tools, gets redirected for auth |

---

### 🛠️ Before Running the MCP Server

1. ✅ Confirm the ToDos API is running locally on port **`8789`**
2. ✅ MCP Server will run locally on port **`8788`**
3. 🧪 MCP Inspector will connect via **SSH transport** to `localhost:8788`

### 🚦 OAuth2 Authorization Flow (with Real-Time Logs)

Here’s what happened during the test:

1. 🧭 **User starts MCP Inspector**, connects to `localhost:8788` via SSH

2. 🧼 **MCP Server** (acting as OAuth2 server) detects client needs authorization

3. 🧑‍💻 **User is redirected** to a **consent screen** rendered by the MCP server

   - Application name: **MCP Inspector**
   - Scopes requested: `read:todos`, `read:billing`, `openid`, `email`
   - Resource: **ToDos API**

4. ✅ **User clicks "Allow Access"**

   - Authorization request sent to **Auth0**
   - Auth0 validates user identity (via existing session or login)
   - Auth0 redirects back to:

     ```
     http://localhost:8788/callback
     ```

5. 🔁 **MCP Server’s `/callback` endpoint** is triggered

   - Auth0 returns an **authorization code**
   - MCP server exchanges it for **access + ID tokens**
   - MCP server issues a **redirect to the client** (`localhost:6274`)
     → This is the MCP Inspector's **own internal callback URI**

6. 🔐 **Inspector receives access token**

   - It can now use the token to call tools on the MCP server
   - The token is stored securely and sent on every request to verify permissions

### 🔑 Roles in OAuth Flow

| Role                     | Entity            | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧑 **User**              | You               | Owns the data (to-do list)                                  |
| 🧰 **OAuth Client**      | MCP Inspector     | Requests access on your behalf                              |
| 🧠 **OAuth Server**      | Remote MCP Server | Presents consent screen, handles redirects & token exchange |
| 🔐 **Identity Provider** | Auth0             | Authenticates users and issues JWTs (OAuth2 IDP)            |
| 📦 **Resource Server**   | ToDos API         | Where protected data lives (needs access token to serve)    |

### ✅ Why This Flow Matters

- **Secure**: No passwords shared with MCP clients (Inspector, Cloud Desktop, etc.)
- **Scoped Access**: Client only gets access to what it _explicitly_ asked for (e.g., todos)
- **Revocable**: User or admin can revoke access without rotating credentials
- **Standards-Based**: This follows OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect best practices
