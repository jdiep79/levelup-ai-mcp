## 🚀 Deploying the ToDos API to Cloudflare Workers with Auth0 Integration

In this walkthrough, Eden demonstrated how to **deploy a secure ToDos API** using **Cloudflare Workers**, complete with **Auth0 authentication**. This deployment transforms your local secure API into a **globally accessible, serverless function**, using secure token-based access via JWT.

---

### 🧱 What We Achieved

- Deployed `todos API` server to **Cloudflare Workers**
- Used **Wrangler CLI** (`npx wrangler`) for setup and deployment
- Registered **secrets** in Cloudflare (Auth0 domain + audience)
- Confirmed remote API now returns expected **401 Unauthorized** on public access
- Verified valid JWT requests succeed just like in local testing

---

### ⚙️ Step-by-Step Recap

#### 1. **Install and Use Wrangler CLI**

If you don’t have Wrangler globally installed, run everything using `npx`:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put AUTH0_DOMAIN
```

📌 You’ll be prompted to paste the value from your `.dev.vars`, e.g.:

```
https://your-tenant.us.auth0.com
```

Do the same for:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put AUTH0_AUDIENCE
```

✅ This registers the secrets in Cloudflare's [Secrets Manager](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/).

---

#### 2. **Create a Cloudflare Worker Automatically**

The first time you run the `secret put` command, Wrangler will prompt:

```
No worker found. Create it? (yes/no)
```

✅ Say **yes** to auto-create the `todos-api` worker.

---

#### 3. **Deploy the Worker**

Run the deployment:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

📤 This publishes your API to a public Cloudflare worker endpoint (e.g., `https://todos-api.your-user.workers.dev`)

---

#### 4. **Verify Deployment in Cloudflare Dashboard**

- Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
- Navigate to **Workers & Pages → todos-api**
- Under **Settings → Variables**, confirm your 2 secrets are listed:

  - `AUTH0_DOMAIN`
  - `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`

🟢 In the **Routes** tab, once deployed, the “Inactive” tag should disappear.

---

#### 5. **Test the Deployed API**

To confirm deployment:

1. Visit the worker URL (e.g., `https://todos-api.<yourname>.workers.dev`)
   → Response: `401 Unauthorized` ✅

2. Use the same JWT from Auth0’s “Test” tab:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" https://todos-api.<yourname>.workers.dev/api/me
```

✅ This should return the decoded JWT with claims like `sub`, `aud`, and `email`.

3. If you try `/api/todos` without the required `read:todos` scope:
   → Response: `403 Forbidden` as expected.

### 📘 Where to Check for Help

- **README** of `todos-api` project:
  Includes all installation and deployment steps covered here
- **Cloudflare Workers Docs**:

- **Auth0 Docs on APIs and Scopes**:

### 🔄 What’s Next?

You're now ready to **deploy the second half of the system**: the **Remote MCP server**, which:

- Acts as the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server** for MCP clients
- Bridges between the AI agent (e.g., Cursor, Cloud Desktop) and Auth0
- Delegates authentication and issues tokens for API access

📌 This will complete the secure architecture enabling AI applications to access your deployed and protected `todos API`.
