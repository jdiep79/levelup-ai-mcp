## 🧾 Fixing Missing Scope for Billing Info in MCP + Auth0 Flow 🛠️✨

This optional video from Eden helps clarify **why access to billing info failed** and how to **properly fix it by configuring scopes correctly**.

---

### 📌 Problem Recap

- ✅ You were able to access `who-am-i` and `todos`.
- ❌ You could **not access billing information**.
- Why? Because the **required scope** `read:billing` was not included in your Auth0 config.

---

### 🔧 Fix Walkthrough

#### 1. 🧠 Understand Scope Usage

Scopes act like **fine-grained permission flags**:

- They define **what the token allows**.
- The user **consents** to them on the Auth0 authorization screen.
- The **backend APIs validate** that the token contains them.

#### 2. 🔍 Reviewing Scopes in `.dev.vars`

Inside the MCP server’s `.dev.vars`:

```env
AUTH0_SCOPE=openid email profile offline_access read:todos
```

💡 Missing: `read:billing`

---

### 🗂️ Backend API Scope Check

#### `/api/todos`

```ts
app.get('/api/todos', requireScope('read:todos'), handler);
```

✅ ✅ Works because the token had `read:todos`.

#### `/api/billing`

```ts
app.get('/api/billing', requireScope('read:billing'), handler);
```

❌ Fails because token did **not** have `read:billing`.

---

### 🧪 Temporary Hack (Demo Fix)

To test:

- Change `requireScope("read:billing")` → `requireScope("read:todos")` in the `/billing` endpoint.
- Restart only the ToDos API server (`npm run dev`).
- Re-auth through MCP Inspector.
- Try calling `/billing` tool → ✅ Works now (since scope check was bypassed with an available one).

---

### 🧠 Permanent Fix – Homework 🏠✍️

1. **Update `.dev.vars`**:

   ```env
   AUTH0_SCOPE=openid email profile offline_access read:todos read:billing
   ```

2. **Update ToDos API**:

   - Revert `/billing` back to:

     ```ts
     requireScope('read:billing');
     ```

3. **Restart both**:

   - 🟢 MCP Server
   - 🟢 ToDos API

4. **Re-authenticate** via MCP Inspector

5. **Test the tool** `list billing` again → Should now ✅ succeed!

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔑 **Scopes**           | Grant specific permissions; validated by API endpoints                |
| 👤 **User Consent**     | Required via Auth0 login + consent screen                             |
| 🧠 **Backend Enforces** | Uses `requireScope()` middleware to check token claims                |
| 🧪 **Testing Auth**     | Always ensure the required scopes are present and granted by the user |
