# 🌐 Final Test: MCP Server with Cloudflare AI Playground

## 🧪 Objective

Verify the full OAuth 2.0 flow and tool access through the **Cloudflare AI Playground** using the **Remote MCP Server** deployed to Cloudflare, integrated with:

- ✅ Auth0 (Authentication Provider)
- ✅ ToDos API (Resource Server)
- ✅ Cloudflare Playground (OAuth Client)

---

## 🛠 Environment Recap

- **MCP Server URL:** Deployed to Cloudflare Workers
- **Auth Provider:** Auth0
- **Client App:** Cloudflare AI Playground
- **Protected Resources:** `whoami`, `list-todos`, `list-billing`
- **OAuth Flow:** Authorization Code Flow with PKCE and JWT

---

## 🌍 Test Walkthrough

### 1. **Launch the Cloudflare AI Playground**

- The Playground mimics the MCP Inspector, but it's **cloud-hosted**.
- Has a **model selection dropdown** and **chat interface**.

### 2. **Connect to MCP Server**

- You connect using your **Cloudflare Worker URL**, appending `/ssh`.

  ```bash
  https://your-mcp-server-url.cloudflare.workers.dev/ssh
  ```

- Hit **Connect**.

➡️ **Immediately redirected to OAuth consent screen**
🔐 **Client:** Cloudflare Playground
🔐 **Resource:** ToDos API
🔐 **Authorization Server:** MCP Server
🔐 **Auth Provider:** Auth0

---

### 3. **Complete Authorization**

- Click **Allow Access** on the consent screen.
- Auth0 authenticates you, and the MCP server:

  - Receives the **authorization code**
  - Exchanges it for an **access token (JWT)**
  - Now holds a valid token to make authorized requests

📜 **Logs confirm:**

```txt
Authorization code received.
JWT token generated.
```

## 🤖 Tool Testing via Chat Interface

### ✅ `whoami`

Command:

```text
Who am I?
```

📦 **Response:** Decoded JWT with your identity (email, sub, aud, etc.)

---

### ✅ `list-todos`

Command:

```text
List todos
```

📦 **Response:** ToDo items returned from the `todos` API.

⚠️ **Bug Noticed:**

- Cloudflare playground may **fail to render assistant response**.
- ✅ **Raw HTTP response still appears** with correct data.

---

### ❌ `list-billing`

Command:

```text
Billing details
```

🚫 **Response:** `401 Unauthorized`
✅ Expected – because the scope `read:billing` was not included in the original request's OAuth scope.

---

## ✅ Final Status

| Component             | Status                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Auth0 Integration     | ✅ Working                      |
| MCP Server            | ✅ Deployed                     |
| ToDos API             | ✅ Secured                      |
| OAuth Flow            | ✅ Verified                     |
| Cloudflare Playground | ✅ Functional (minor UI glitch) |
| Token Scopes Enforced | ✅ Confirmed                    |

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

Now that the entire **remote OAuth-secured MCP architecture** is deployed and tested:

- 🔄 You can safely **integrate into your production app** (e.g., Cloud Desktop).
- 📦 Or further test with **more tools and scopes**.
- 🧪 Bonus: Try adding `read:billing` to scope and validate access end-to-end again.
