Here’s a detailed **Markdown summary with emojis** for Eden’s walkthrough of the **JWT Middleware for the To-Dos API**:

---

## 🔐 JWT Middleware for To-Dos API (Auth0 Integration)

This section walks through the **middleware logic** that secures the API using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** issued by **Auth0**, ensuring requests are both authenticated and authorized before accessing protected routes.

---

### 🧾 Purpose of `jwt.ts`

This file:

- Validates **JWT tokens** for every request 🔍
- Ensures the token is **genuine and not tampered** with ✍️
- Checks that the token is **intended for this specific API** 🎯
- Extracts the token's **claims and metadata** for use in the app 📤

---

### 🌍 Required Environment Variables

To function correctly, the middleware needs:

| Variable            | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AUTH0_DOMAIN` 🏢   | Your Auth0 tenant domain (e.g. `dev-abc123.us.auth0.com`). Used to find and validate public keys 🔑 |
| `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` 🎯 | The API identifier defined in Auth0. Used to check if the token is meant for this specific API      |

⛔ Without these, you'll get an error:

> `JWT auth middleware requires options.auth0Domain`

---

### 🔧 Key Functions in the Middleware

#### 1. `JWT()`

- Verifies token **authenticity** and **integrity**
- Validates signature using **Auth0's public keys**
- Checks if token was **issued by the correct domain**
- Ensures `aud` claim matches expected audience

#### 2. `requireScope(scope: string)`

- Ensures token contains the **required scope** (e.g. `read:todos`)
- Used to enforce **fine-grained access control**

---

### ⚠️ Token Confusion Protection

The `aud` (audience) check helps prevent **token confusion attacks**, where tokens meant for one service are used maliciously on another.

---

### 💻 Running the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This executes `wrangler dev`, spinning up a local Cloudflare Worker at:

```
http://localhost:8789
```

---

### 🧨 First Run Error (Expected)

You’ll see:

> `Internal Server Error` > `JWT auth middleware requires options.auth0Domain`

📌 This happens because the `.env` variables weren’t set yet.

---

### 📘 Fix: Set Environment Variables

Refer to the **Auth0 blog post** (linked in course resources) for guidance on setting:

```bash
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-tenant.auth0.com
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://your-api-identifier
```

Add these to your `.env` file or `wrangler.toml` environment config.

---

## ✅ Summary

- 🛡 Middleware ensures every API request is secure
- 📥 It verifies the JWT against Auth0’s keys
- 🔐 Uses scopes and claims for authorization
- ⚠️ Must configure environment before running

> ✅ Once set up, your API becomes a **secure endpoint**—ready for integration with **remote MCP clients** and **AI agents**.
