Here's your full walkthrough of the final deployment stage of the **Remote MCP Server** to **Cloudflare**, along with all necessary configuration and secrets setup. This concludes the infrastructure layer of your OAuth-based MCP system.

# 🚀 MCP Server Deployment to Cloudflare

## 📌 Objective

Deploy the **Remote MCP Server** (acting as the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server) to Cloudflare Workers and integrate it with:

- Auth0 (OAuth provider)
- ToDos API (Resource Server)
- MCP Inspector (OAuth Client)

---

## 🔑 Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. **Upload Secrets to Cloudflare**

Use the `wrangler secret put` CLI command for each required secret:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put AUTH0_DOMAIN
npx wrangler secret put AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put AUTH0_SCOPE
npx wrangler secret put AUTH0_AUDIENCE
npx wrangler secret put API_BASE_URL
```

⚠️ Note:

- `API_BASE_URL` should point to the **Cloudflare Worker URL** of the deployed **ToDos API**.
- `NODE_ENV` is optional unless you condition logic on it.

✅ These secrets appear in **Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers → \[Your Worker] → Settings → Variables**.

---

### 2. **Create and Deploy the Worker**

If it's the first time deploying this MCP worker:

- The `wrangler secret` command will prompt you:

  > "Worker not found. Create one named `mcp-auth0-oidc`?"

✔️ Say **yes**.

Then deploy:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

👀 If you get an error like:

```
Could not resolve module
```

👉 Just run:

```bash
npm install
```

…and retry the deploy.

---

### 3. **Update Auth0 Callback URLs**

Navigate to:

> **Auth0 Dashboard → Applications → Remote MCP Server → Settings**

Update **Allowed Callback URLs**:

```
http://localhost:8788/callback,
https://<YOUR-MCP-WORKER>.cloudflare.workers.dev/callback
```

📎 This ensures that both local and cloud environments are authorized for the OAuth redirect.

---

## 🧪 Final Checklist

✅ **ToDos API** deployed to Cloudflare
✅ **Remote MCP Server** deployed to Cloudflare
✅ **Secrets configured in Cloudflare**
✅ **Callback URL updated in Auth0**
✅ Ready to connect **MCP Inspector** or any OAuth-compliant client

---

## 🛠 What's Next?

You're now set up for **remote testing**. In the next step:

- 🧪 You'll run the **Cloudflare MCP Client**
- 🎯 Connect it to the deployed **MCP Server**
- 🔐 Test real OAuth 2.0 flows between:

  - Auth0 (auth provider)
  - MCP Server (auth server)
  - ToDos API (resource server)
  - MCP Client (OAuth client)

After that, it's ✨ integration with **Cloud Desktop** (your PHP host and agent environment).
