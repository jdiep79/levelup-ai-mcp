# ✅ Final Integration: Connecting Cloud Desktop with Remote MCP via MCP Proxy

Hey there 👋 — Eden here!
We're at the **home stretch** of integrating everything together. Let’s break down what just happened and how we **connected Cloud Desktop (MCP host)** to the **remote MCP server** deployed on Cloudflare via a **local proxy** called `mcp-remote`.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Here’s the updated component flow:

```
Cloud Desktop (local MCP Host)
        ⬇️
     MCP Proxy (`mcp-remote`)
        ⬇️
Remote MCP Server (Cloudflare Worker)
        ⬇️
      Auth0 (OAuth Provider)
        ⬇️
     ToDos API (Cloudflare Worker)
```

This proxy enables Cloud Desktop (which only supports local `stdio` connections) to interact with remote servers over the internet.

---

## 🛠 Steps Recap

### 1. **Install MCP Proxy (🧰 `mcp-remote`)**

```bash
sudo npm install -g @cloudflare/mcp-remote
```

> This CLI tool acts as a **bridge** between Cloud Desktop and your remote MCP server.

Verify install:

```bash
which mcp-remote
# e.g. /usr/local/bin/mcp-remote
```

---

### 2. **Configure `cloud-desktop`**

Update the `config.json` file in your Cloud Desktop directory:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "todos",
      "command": "mcp-remote",
      "args": ["https://your-remote-mcp-url.cloudflare.workers.dev/ssh"]
    }
  ]
}
```

> Replace the URL with your actual deployed MCP Worker address.

---

### 3. **Launch Cloud Desktop**

```bash
cloud
```

- You’ll be **redirected to Auth0’s consent screen**.
- Grant permissions for the scopes requested (`openid`, `email`, `read:todos`, etc.).

---

### 4. **Successful Authorization**

Once authorized:
✅ Cloud Desktop receives an access token from the MCP server
✅ The MCP server got it from Auth0
✅ The proxy passed it all through locally to Cloud Desktop

## 🧪 Tool Invocation Test Results

| Tool                | Status          | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧍‍♂️ `whoami`         | ✅ Success      | JWT decoded, user info printed (email, ID, etc.)      |
| ✅ `list-todos`     | ✅ Success      | Returns the mock ToDo list from the secured API       |
| 💸 `billing report` | ❌ Unauthorized | Scope `read:billing` not granted during Auth0 consent |

---

## 🧠 Gotchas & Insights

### 🤖 Why do we need the proxy?

Because **Cloud Desktop only supports local `stdio`** protocol. `mcp-remote` serves as a **local bridge** that forwards traffic to a remote `SSH` endpoint (the MCP Server on Cloudflare).

### 🔒 Scopes Matter

To access `billing report`, you must:

- Add `"read:billing"` to the `AUTH0_SCOPE` in `.dev.vars`
- Update the Auth0 app's scope config
- Redeploy MCP server
- Reauthorize with updated scope

---

## 🔄 Coming Soon: Streamable HTTP

A future update will **remove the need for a proxy** altogether:

- Cloud Desktop will natively support **Streamable HTTP**
- Direct access to Cloudflare MCP server via secure HTTP transport
- Seamless user experience

> ✨ You won’t need `mcp-remote` anymore once this rolls out!

## ✅ Status Summary

| Component                   | Status       |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| 🧠 Remote MCP Server        | ✅ Deployed  |
| 🔒 Auth0 Integration        | ✅ Working   |
| 📦 ToDos API                | ✅ Secured   |
| 🧍 Cloud Desktop (MCP Host) | ✅ Connected |
| 🔁 Proxy (`mcp-remote`)     | ✅ Bridged   |
| 🔐 Scopes + Auth Flow       | ✅ Enforced  |
