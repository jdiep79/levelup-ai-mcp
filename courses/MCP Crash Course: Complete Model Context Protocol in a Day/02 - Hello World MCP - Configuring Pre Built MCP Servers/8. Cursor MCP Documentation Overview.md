**🧠 Intro**

Ethan continues the MCP server tutorial by showing how to **integrate the weather MCP server with Cursor**, a popular AI-powered IDE. He walks through the updated Cursor documentation, explains different transport methods, discusses global vs. per-project configurations, and emphasizes security practices when running untrusted MCP servers locally.

[Model Context Protocol Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)

**📚 Summary**

- MCP servers can now be configured inside Cursor by defining how the agent should run them.
- Cursor supports multiple **transport types**, the most common being **stdin/stdout**.
- You can define MCP servers **globally** or **per project** in `.cursor/mcp.json`.
- Cursor has **manual tool approval** by default for safety but also offers an **auto-approve ("YOLO mode")** for power users.
- Security risks such as **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** from malicious MCP servers are acknowledged, and safety practices are recommended.

**🗝️ Key Concepts**

- 🔌 **Transport Protocols in Cursor**:

  - `stdin/stdout`: Local execution, reads/writes from terminal input/output.
  - `SSE (Server-Sent Events)`: For future remote server support.

- 📂 **MCP Configuration File**:

  - Format: JSON
  - Location:

    - Global: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
    - Project-specific: `your-project/.cursor/mcp.json`

- 🧰 **Configuration Example (NodeJS MCP Server)**:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "weather",
      "command": "node /absolute/path/to/build/index.js",
      "env": {
        "YOUR_ENV_VAR": "value"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- 🔐 **Tool Approval Flow**:

  - Cursor will **ask for confirmation** before running any MCP tool.
  - You’ll see:

    - Tool name
    - Arguments it wants to run with

- 🕶️ **YOLO Mode**:

  - Skips approval dialogs.
  - Cursor runs MCP tools automatically.
  - ⚠️ Not recommended for enterprise or untrusted servers.

**🪜 Step-by-Step Recap**

1. ✅ Clone & build the weather MCP server (`index.js`).
2. 🛠️ Go to Cursor's official MCP documentation.
3. 📄 Add server definition to `mcp.json` (either globally or per project).
4. 💻 Define:

   - Server `name`
   - Shell `command` to run your MCP server
   - Optional `env` values for API keys, etc.

5. 🔒 Let Cursor prompt you when a tool is about to run (default).
6. 🔁 Optionally enable YOLO mode for auto-approval (not safe for prod use).

**🔐 Security Practices**

| ✅ Safe                        | ❌ Risky                         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Manual tool approvals          | YOLO mode in shared/dev machines |
| Verified MCP repos             | Unreviewed GitHub clones         |
| Minimal environment privileges | Broad API keys in `.env`         |

- 🧨 Local MCP servers are technically **RCE vectors**.
- 🧑‍💻 Always **review code** before executing unknown MCP servers.
- ⚠️ Be mindful of **supply chain attacks**.

---

**💡 Tips & Notes**

- 🧱 Node.js and Python MCP setups are interchangeable at the config level.
- 🛠️ Cursor will respect all settings from your `.cursor/mcp.json` file.
- 📌 No API key is needed for the weather example (public API).
- 🚀 Cursor’s recent changes required **refilming the course**—watch out for outdated docs and always double-check.
