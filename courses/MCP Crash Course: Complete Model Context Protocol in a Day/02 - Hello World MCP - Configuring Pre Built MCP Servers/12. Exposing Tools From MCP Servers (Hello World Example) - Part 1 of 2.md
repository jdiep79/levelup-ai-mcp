**🌩️ Intro**

Eden transitions from the theory of connecting prebuilt MCP servers into a **deeper understanding of building MCP servers from scratch**. This read-only walkthrough introduces the **core structure, components, and SDK usage** involved in building a Python-based MCP server. It introduces the three major capabilities MCP servers can expose and walks through the **boilerplate setup** of the Python Weather MCP server.

**📚 Summary**

MCP servers can expose three types of resources to language models:

1. 📄 **Resources** – passive context: files, PDFs, datasets, lists, APIs, etc.
2. 🛠️ **Functions** – active tools to be executed (e.g., `getForecast`, `getAlerts`).
3. 💬 **Prompts** – dynamic templates with placeholders for reusable prompt engineering.

This video focuses on **functions**, using the **Python version** of the Weather MCP server for demonstration. Eden walks through how the server is initialized using the **FastMCP SDK**, and sets the foundation for tool exposure using Python.

---

**🗝️ Key Concepts**

- 📦 **Resources**: Add context to the LLM, not directly executable.
- ⚙️ **Functions (Tools)**: Executable actions, can be manually or auto-approved.
- 🧠 **Prompts**: Prebuilt templates, similar to LangChain's prompt templates.

**📂 Project Setup Walkthrough (Python MCP Server)**

1. **🧱 Create Project Directory**

   ```bash
   uvicorn init weather
   ```

2. **🌀 Create Virtual Environment**

   - Activates isolated dependencies.

3. **📥 Install Dependencies**

   - Install MCP SDK: `fastmcp`
   - Install HTTP libraries like `httpx`.

4. **📝 Create Weather Server File**

   - `weather.py` — main server implementation.

5. **📄 pyproject.toml**

   - Declares project metadata and dependencies.
   - Entry point: `weather.py:main`.

---

**🧪 Inside `weather.py`: MCP Server Boilerplate**

```python
from typing import Any
import httpx
from fastmcp import FastMCP  # From the MCP Python SDK

server = FastMCP(name="weather")  # Initialize MCP server
```

- 📛 `FastMCP(name="weather")`: Creates a named MCP server instance.
- 🌐 Sets constants for:

  - `BASE_URL` — endpoint for fetching weather data.
  - `USER_AGENT` — included in requests to identify the application.

🧊 At this point:
The server exists, but **does nothing yet** — it’s just a stub with a name and some metadata.

---

**🧰 Adding Capability: Tool Definition**

- ✅ The next step (not fully covered yet) will involve:

  - Writing a function like `get_forecast()`
  - Registering it with `server.tool(...)`
  - This wraps it as a callable tool exposed to LLMs via MCP.

**💡 Why This Matters**

| Concept                    | Importance                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| SDK-based server creation  | Clean, structured, multi-language                           |
| Understanding capabilities | Pick the right exposure method (resource, function, prompt) |
| Protocol flexibility       | Works in Node, Python, Java                                 |
| Tool exposure              | Core of agent interactivity via MCP                         |

**🔐 Security Reminder**

- MCP servers can be powerful and dangerous.
- When exposing tools, **understand the actions your agent can invoke**.
- Later in the course, Eden will cover **approval layers and validation**.

---

**💡 Tips & Best Practices**

- 🧪 Use `pyproject.toml` for dependency management.
- 🧰 Stick to the MCP SDKs for tool exposure — they abstract a lot of protocol complexity.
- 🧠 Think in layers:

  - Setup → Server init → Tool registration → Tool logic.

- 🔁 Watch for common patterns across languages (NodeJS & Python are similar in structure).

You're now equipped with the mental model to move from "using" to "building" MCP servers — let’s keep going! 🚀🐍
