**🌦️ Intro**

Eden walks through the complete implementation of a **Python-based Weather MCP Server**, showcasing how to expose tools to clients using the `@tool` decorator from the **FastMCP SDK**. This video is a **read-only walkthrough**, meant to teach the structure and logic behind a functioning MCP server, with emphasis on exposing tools—not the weather API logic itself.

---

**📚 Summary**

This Python MCP server demonstrates:

- How to build and expose **MCP tools** using async coroutines.
- How to use the **FastMCP SDK**.
- How to register functions (`get_forecast`, `get_alerts`) as tools.
- The importance of well-written **descriptions and argument signatures** to ensure LLMs can invoke tools correctly.
- Finally, how to **run the server locally using `stdio`** and integrate it with clients like Cursor or Cloud.

**🗝️ Key Concepts**

### 🔧 Helper Coroutines

1. **`make_nws_request(url)`**

   - Makes async HTTP requests to the **National Weather Service (NWS)**.
   - Uses `httpx.AsyncClient` for non-blocking calls.
   - Abstracted to focus on MCP tooling, not the external API logic.

2. **`format_alert(feature)`**

   - Formats alert data from NWS into a human-readable string.
   - Includes: event, severity, description, and instructions.
   - Helps clean up raw JSON for LLM consumption.

### 🛠️ Tool Definitions with `@tool` Decorator

#### ✅ `get_forecast`

```python
@server.tool
async def get_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> str:
    """Get weather forecast for a location."""
    ...
```

- Decorated with `@server.tool` to register it.
- Takes `latitude` and `longitude` as arguments.
- Returns a weather summary including temperature, wind, forecast, and time.
- **Description is critical**: It guides the LLM's decision to use this tool.

#### 🚨 `get_alerts`

```python
@server.tool
async def get_alerts(state: str) -> str:
    """Get active weather alerts for a U.S. state."""
    ...
```

- Also decorated with `@server.tool`.
- Takes a `state` (like `"California"` or `"New York"`) and fetches alerts.
- Uses `format_alert()` to clean up the output before returning.

### 🚀 Running the MCP Server

#### 🧩 Entry Point:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run(transport="stdio")
```

- **`transport="stdio"`**:

  - Communicates via standard input/output.
  - Compatible with clients like **Cursor** and **Cloud Desktop**.

- Server can now be invoked using:

  ```bash
  python weather.py
  ```

### 📂 Directory & File Setup

| File                | Purpose                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `weather.py`        | Main MCP server implementation        |
| `pyproject.toml`    | Declares dependencies and entry point |
| Virtual Environment | Manages Python packages               |

---

**🔐 Key Security Reminder**

- MCP tools run code the LLMs can invoke.
- Always sanitize inputs and validate tool access.
- Exposing an endpoint = exposing execution.

**🧠 Best Practices for Tool Exposure**

| Practice                          | Reason                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Use accurate `@tool` descriptions | Helps LLMs choose the right tool     |
| Keep helper functions clean       | Easier maintenance & reusability     |
| Avoid ambiguous argument names    | Prevents misinterpretation by agents |
| Prefer `async` where possible     | Enables concurrent tool execution    |

---

**💡 Integration Tip**

To run this server in Cloud or Cursor:

- Add the following entry to your client config:

```json
{
  "name": "weather",
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["/absolute/path/to/weather.py"]
}
```

- Ensure `"name"` matches the MCP server identifier.

**🔜 Coming Up**

> Eden will later guide you through **implementing your own MCP server** from scratch using similar structure — but with a different use case.

You now have full visibility into what it takes to build, expose, and run a real MCP server — and you're ready for hands-on coding next! 🐍🌐🛠️
