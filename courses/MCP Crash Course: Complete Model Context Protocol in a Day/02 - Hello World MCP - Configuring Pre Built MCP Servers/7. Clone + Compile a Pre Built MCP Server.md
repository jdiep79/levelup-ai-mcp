**🌦️ Intro**

Ethan walks us through configuring our **first MCP server** using a **weather server example** provided by the Model Context Protocol's Quickstart documentation. This hands-on tutorial demonstrates how to integrate a prebuilt MCP server into agents like **Cursor** and **Cloud**, running it **locally** on your machine.

---

**🧭 Summary**

This tutorial shows how to:

- Set up an MCP server locally using Node.js.
- Integrate it with AI agents like Cursor and Cloud.
- Fix common install issues (like package lock conflicts).
- Stay safe while using third-party MCP servers from the ecosystem.

By the end, you'll know how to **run and connect to a prebuilt MCP server** and configure it as a tool endpoint for AI agents.

**🗝️ Key Concepts**

- 🛠️ **MCP Server**: A standalone server that AI agents can connect to for tool functionality (like weather, DB access, etc.).
- 🧩 **Two Types**:

  - Local: runs on your machine.
  - Remote: cloud-deployed and externally managed (coming soon via Anthropic).

- 🌐 **Weather MCP Server**: Used here as the example to demonstrate setup.
- 🧱 **Project Organization Tip**: Create a `MCP-servers` directory to manage all MCP servers you work with.

**📦 Setup Instructions**

1. **📁 Create a Directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir MCP-servers
   cd MCP-servers
   ```

2. **🔗 Clone the Quickstart Repo**
   Go to [Model Context Protocol GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources.git) and clone the **weather server (TypeScript)**.

3. **🛠️ Node.js Support**

   - Ensure `node` and `npm` are installed:

     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

   - If not, download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

4. **📂 Navigate to the Project**

   ```bash
   cd quickstart-resources/weather-server-typescript
   ```

5. **🐛 Fix Install Bug**
   If you see dependency/version errors:

   - Delete `package-lock.json`
   - Then:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

6. **🏗️ Build the Server**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

7. **📦 Output**

   - You’ll get a `build/` directory.
   - `index.js` is your compiled server entry point.

---

**🤝 Integration**

- Agents like **Cursor** and **Cloud Desktop** need to know how to run this server.
- You only need to specify the local path or start command.
- Once running, the agents can query it to fetch weather data from weather.gov via API.

---

**⚠️ Security Reminder**

- 🕵️‍♂️ Be cautious when using open-source MCP servers.
- 📦 MCP servers run code directly on your machine.
- 🚨 Malicious packages = potential supply chain attacks.
- ✅ Only use verified, trusted sources.

**✅ Pros & ❌ Cons**

| ✅ Pros                             | ❌ Cons                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Easy to run MCP locally             | Installation errors (e.g., version mismatch) |
| Simple integration with agents      | No remote support yet (in development)       |
| Open-source + extensible            | Supply chain security risks                  |
| Learn by example using real servers | Must understand basic Node.js setup          |

**💡 Tips & Notes**

- 📚 The course will later cover building MCP servers **from scratch** in both **Node.js** and **Python**.
- 🧪 Don't worry if you're not a Node developer — setting this up is minimal and mostly copy-paste.
- 🔐 More detailed **security practices** will be taught in future lessons.
