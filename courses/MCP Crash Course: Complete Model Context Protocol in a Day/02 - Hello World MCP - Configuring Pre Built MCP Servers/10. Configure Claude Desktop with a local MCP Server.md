**☁️ Intro**

Ethan transitions from Cursor to **Cloud Desktop**, showing how to configure the same **Weather MCP Server**. By integrating the MCP client into Cloud Desktop using a configuration JSON file, he demonstrates how to **enable the same tools** (`getForecast`, `getAlerts`) within another agent-powered environment. This reinforces the value of **MCP’s interoperability** across platforms.

---

**📚 Summary**

- Cloud Desktop also supports MCP via a local config file.
- You provide **MCP server details** (name, command, arguments) inside `cloud-desktop-config.json`.
- Once configured and restarted, Cloud can use the weather server just like Cursor.
- Cloud, like Cursor, prompts for tool approval unless set to auto-approve.
- Removing or misconfiguring the server disables those tools until fixed.

---

**🗝️ Key Concepts**

- 🧭 **`cloud-desktop-config.json`**: Config file used by Cloud Desktop to run and connect to MCP servers.

- ⚙️ **Configuration Format**:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": [
      {
        "name": "weather",
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["/absolute/path/to/build/index.js"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- 🧩 **Shared Protocol, Shared Setup**:

  - Cloud and Cursor both use the **MCP standard**.
  - This allows shared servers and tools between apps without duplicate work.

**🪜 Step-by-Step: Connect MCP Server to Cloud Desktop**

1. **🖥️ Open Cloud Desktop**

   - Go to `Settings → Developer`.

2. **📝 Edit MCP Config**

   - Click “Edit Config”.
   - Open `cloud-desktop-config.json`.

3. **💡 Add MCP Server Entry**

   - Copy the MCP JSON format from official docs or Cursor example.
   - Provide:

     - `name`: your server's label (e.g., "weather")
     - `command`: how to start it (`node`)
     - `args`: absolute path to `index.js` (compiled MCP server)

4. **💾 Save and Restart Cloud Desktop**

   - Quit Cloud completely and reopen it.
   - You’ll now see a 🛠️ hammer icon indicating MCP tools were loaded.

5. **🧪 Test It**

   - Prompt: “What’s the weather in San Francisco right now?”
   - Cloud will:

     - Call `getForecast` with lat/lon.
     - Optionally call `getAlerts` with state name (e.g., California).
     - Prompt you to approve tool invocation.

6. **🔁 Test Removing MCP Server**

   - Delete the MCP config entry.
   - Restart Cloud.
   - Prompt the same weather query.
   - Result: it **fails** because the tool is no longer available.

**🔐 Security and Tool Approval in Cloud**

- ✅ Cloud prompts for tool invocation (just like Cursor).
- 🔐 You can:

  - “Allow once”
  - “Always allow”

- ⚠️ This prevents **silent execution of untrusted code** from 3rd-party MCP servers.

---

**💡 Tips & Best Practices**

- 🧠 If you forget to restart Cloud, changes to MCP config won’t take effect.
- 🔁 If it keeps working after deletion, **restart Cloud Desktop** to refresh config.
- 🔍 Keep MCP JSON in sync between Cursor and Cloud if you're using both.
- 🚨 Like in Cursor, always **validate source code** before running third-party servers.

**🧠 What You Learned**

- How to configure an MCP server in Cloud Desktop using JSON.
- How Cloud uses MCP tools just like Cursor.
- How to enable and disable tools via JSON config and restart cycle.
- That **MCP enables once-written tools to work across different agent environments**.
