**🌦️ Intro**

Ethan now demonstrates how to **fully integrate and test** the weather MCP server inside Cursor. This includes updating the `mcp.json` configuration file, verifying tool discovery, and confirming that Cursor can use those tools (like `getForecast` and `getAlerts`) to respond with real-time weather data.

---

**📚 Summary**

Cursor alone can't access real-time weather data. By **configuring a local MCP server** (Node.js weather server), we enable Cursor to access **weather tools**. Ethan shows how to update the `mcp.json` file, validate the integration, and test with a query like "What's the weather in San Francisco?"

---

**🗝️ Key Concepts**

- 📁 **`.cursor/mcp.json`**: Cursor config file that tells it how to run MCP servers.
- 🧩 **MCP Server Name**: Used to label the server (e.g., `"weather"`).
- 🖥️ **Local Transport (stdio)**: Server communicates via stdin/stdout.
- ⚙️ **Command Configuration**: Specifies how to run the server, e.g., `node /path/to/build/index.js`.
- 🔍 **Tool Discovery**: Cursor detects tools like `getForecast` and `getAlerts` from the server.

**🪜 Step-by-Step: Configure Cursor to Use MCP Server**

1. **🛠️ Try a Weather Query Without MCP**

   - Prompt: “What is the weather in San Francisco right now?”
   - Result: Cursor says it can't access real-time weather data.

2. **📁 Navigate to MCP Settings in Cursor**

   - Open `Settings → MCP`.
   - Add a **global MCP server**.
   - This edits the file at: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`.

3. **📄 Add Your MCP Server Configuration**

   - Example payload:

     ```json
     {
       "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
         {
           "command": "node",
           "args": ["path to index.js file"]
         }
        }
       }
     }
     ```

   - Make sure the path to `index.js` is **correct** (it’s case-sensitive and must point to the built file).
   - Use `pwd` to get absolute path

4. **✅ Verify the MCP Server**

   - Cursor should now show:

     - ✅ Status: Valid
     - 🛠️ Tools: `getForecast`, `getAlerts`

   - If it shows “client close” or errors:

     - Double-check the path to `index.js`.

5. **🧪 Test the Setup**

   - Prompt Cursor again: “What’s the weather in San Francisco right now?”
   - Cursor:

     - Identifies coordinates for San Francisco
     - Calls `getForecast` tool with those coordinates
       - Agent is smart enough to get the coordinates to pass to the function
     - Also calls `getAlerts` with the state (e.g., "California")
       - Agent is smart enough to get the state to pass to the function

6. **📦 Tools in Action**

   - `getForecast`: Uses lat/lon to fetch weather
   - `getAlerts`: Checks for any active weather warnings
   - Results are shown in the conversation!

**🔐 Security Note**

- 💣 Since you're running unknown code locally, this setup has **RCE risk**.
- ✅ Only use MCP servers from **trusted sources**.
- 👁️ Cursor shows **tool name + arguments** before execution for transparency.

---

**💡 Tips & Best Practices**

- 🌐 Use **absolute paths** for the build file.
- 🧪 Always test after configuration by invoking a known tool (like a weather query).
- 🛠️ You don’t need an API key for this example — the weather API is public.
- 🔁 If you move directories, **update the path** in `mcp.json`.

**🧠 What You Learned**

- How to configure MCP servers globally in Cursor.
- How Cursor uses stdin/stdout to communicate with locally running MCP servers.
- How to troubleshoot path errors.
- How Cursor routes a query to your custom MCP tool.
