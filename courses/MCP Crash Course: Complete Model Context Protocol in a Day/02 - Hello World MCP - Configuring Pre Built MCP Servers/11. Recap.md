**🧠 Intro**

Eden sets the stage for the **second phase of learning MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: moving beyond treating servers as black boxes and beginning to understand how they're built. The focus now shifts to exploring the **internal structure of an MCP server**, using the Weather server from the Quickstart repo as a walkthrough example.

---

**📚 Summary**

- Previous videos showed how to **use** a prebuilt MCP server (e.g., Weather) and **connect it** to clients like Cursor and Cloud Desktop.
- This next section dives **under the hood** of the server itself.
- The upcoming walkthroughs will explore how an MCP server is **structured**, how it uses the **MCP SDK**, and how it **exposes tools**.
- These videos are not hands-on implementations yet — just **exploratory walkthroughs** to build foundational understanding before building your own.

---

**🗝️ Key Concepts**

- 🧱 **Black Box Phase (Done)**:

  - Clone → Build → Connect → Use.
  - No need to understand the code inside.

- 🔍 **Code Walkthrough Phase (Now)**:

  - Understand internal design of the Weather MCP server.
  - Focus on:

    - 🧰 How tools are exposed via the MCP SDK.
    - 🧠 How the server is structured, not the weather API logic itself.

- 💡 **MCP SDK**:

  - The core library used to simplify tool exposure and standard protocol handling in MCP servers.

- 🛠️ **Tool Exposure**:

  - Each MCP server defines tools (e.g., `getForecast`, `getAlerts`) that the agent can invoke.
  - The walkthrough will show how these are **defined, registered, and handled**.

**🎯 Learning Goals for This Phase**

| Goal                      | Outcome                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Understand MCP SDK        | Know how tools are created and exposed   |
| Understand server anatomy | Know what files and patterns are typical |
| Ignore API logic          | Stay focused on MCP-specific elements    |
| Prep for hands-on coding  | Be ready to build your own server later  |

**💡 Tips & Notes**

- 📺 These walkthroughs are **passive** — no code implementation yet.
- 🔍 Take note of:

  - Tool registration
  - SDK usage patterns
  - Server structure and file layout

- 🚧 API integrations (e.g., calling weather.gov) are considered **non-essential** for now.

**🔜 Coming Up**

> In the upcoming videos, Eden will:
>
> - Walk through the source code of the Weather MCP server
> - Highlight the pieces responsible for MCP interaction
> - Set the stage for **you to build your own custom MCP server**

You're about to gain deeper insight into how the magic of tool invocation works inside MCP — let’s dive under the hood! 🔧📦
