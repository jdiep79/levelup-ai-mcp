## 🤖 Setting Up the LangChain Multi-Server MCP Client

This session walks you through the **boilerplate setup for a LangChain-based MCP client** that connects to **multiple MCP servers** — specifically a math server over `stdio` and a weather server over `SSE`.

---

### 🧠 Recap: MCP Server Setup

- 🧮 **Math MCP Server** (uses `Stdio`)

  - Run with:

    ```bash
    uv run servers/math.py
    ```

- 🌦️ **Weather MCP Server** (uses `SSE`)

  - Run with:

    ```bash
    uv run servers/weather_server.py
    ```

  - Runs on port `8000`

### 🧪 Step-by-Step: LangChain MCP Client (Multi-Server)

#### 📁 1. **Create `langchain_client.py`**

This file is responsible for spinning up an agent that can interface with both MCP servers.

So remember I told you there is a 1 to 1 connection between a client and an MCP server. So this is still the case. LangChain abstracts it for us. And inside it we're going to have multiple MCP clients. But we can use that to easily connect to multiple MCP servers without explicitly writing the clients for each one of those servers.

#### 📥 2. **Imports**

```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import asyncio
```

#### ⚙️ 3. **Initialize Chat LLM**

```python
load_dotenv()
llm = ChatOpenAI()
```

#### 🧪 4. **Sanity Check Main Function**

```python
async def main():
    print("Hello LangChain MCP")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run with:

```bash
uv run langchain_client.py
```

✅ Output should confirm:

```
Hello LangChain MCP
```

### 🧩 What’s Coming Next?

You're now ready to:

- Connect the `MultiServerMCPClient` to:

  - 🧮 Math MCP server (via `stdio`)
  - 🌦️ Weather MCP server (via `SSE`)

- Convert tools from MCP to LangChain tools
- Register them into a `react` agent
- Send user queries that invoke tools from both servers

This sets the foundation for creating powerful multi-tool agents with clean separation between **tool orchestration** and **tool execution** — all abstracted through LangChain & MCP.

🧠 Stay tuned: the next session will cover connecting and registering both clients + querying tools!
