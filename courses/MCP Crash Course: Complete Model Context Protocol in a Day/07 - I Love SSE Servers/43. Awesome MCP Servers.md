## 🔍 Discovering and Integrating Cool MCP Servers

### 👋 Intro

In this session, Eden introduces how to discover a wide variety of MCP (Modular Capability Protocol) servers. These servers are like plugins for your AI agents — enabling capabilities such as browsing the web, sending WhatsApp messages, running terminal commands, querying databases, and much more.

## 📚 Summary

- You can discover **tons of MCP servers** for various tasks (food ordering, messaging, automation, etc.).
- The best place to find them is an **actively maintained GitHub repository**.
- The repo is ⭐ popular (35K+ stars) and updated frequently.
- It includes:

  - Tags for OS compatibility 🖥️
  - Programming language used 🐍/🟨
  - Whether it’s local or remote (cloud API) ☁️
  - Official vs. community-maintained implementations ✅

## 🧭 How to Find MCP Servers

### 🔍 Google Search

Search for:

```
MCP server directory site:github.com
```

### 💎 Recommended Repository

## 🧩 Categories of MCP Servers

### 🗄️ Databases

- Supabase
- Neo4j
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Chroma (for vector search)

### 🌐 Web Search & Data Extraction

- Tools that enable LLMs to search the internet for real-time data

### 🌍 Browser Automation

- Playwright-based servers to enable autonomous web navigation

### 💬 Communication Tools

- Gmail
- WhatsApp
- Telegram
- Discord
- Twilio

### 🧰 Terminal Tools

## 🧑‍💻 GitHub vs. SaaS UI

### 🐙 GitHub View

- Browse by code and readme
- Clone & run servers yourself
- Requires Git proficiency

### 🌐 Web UI (SaaS-style)

- Clean search bar
- Categorized browsing
- No Git required
- Search for servers like:

  - `notion` → Notion integrations
  - `playwright` → Web automation
  - `chrome` → Browser tools
  - `gmail` → Email MCPs

---

## 🛡️ Trust & Verification

- ✅ Official MCPs are marked clearly — e.g., Microsoft Playwright
- ⚠️ Community-maintained MCPs may need extra validation before production use

---

## 🛠️ Final Tip: Integration

- Clone any MCP server you like
- Deploy it locally or to the cloud
- Connect it to agents in **Cursor IDE** or **LangGraph** using MCP clients
- Enjoy modular, scalable tool invocation for your AI systems
