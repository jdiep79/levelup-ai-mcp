## 🧠 Integrating the Microsoft Playwright MCP Server with Cursor

### 👋 Intro

This section walks through how to locally integrate the **official Microsoft Playwright MCP server** into your **Cursor IDE project**. The Playwright MCP lets AI agents browse the web through your own browser — enabling LLMs to perform real-time, interactive tasks like reading pages, collecting info, and clicking elements.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Integration

### 1. 📋 Clone the Playwright MCP Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp.git
cd playwright-mcp
```

This brings all the source code of the server to your machine.

---

### 2. 🗂️ Create `.cursor` Config

In your **Cursor IDE project**, do the following:

- Create a folder called `.cursor`
- Inside it, create a file called `mcp.json`

```bash
mkdir .cursor
touch .cursor/mcp.json
```

---

### 3. 🧾 Paste the Server Config

Grab the example config from the Playwright MCP repo’s README (it includes the command to run the MCP server locally) and paste it into `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "playwright": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["index.js"],
    "cwd": "./path-to-playwright-server",
    "transport": "stdio"
  }
}
```

> Make sure the path is correct and matches where you cloned the repo.

---

### 4. ✅ Enable MCP in Cursor

Once `mcp.json` is saved, **Cursor will auto-detect the MCP**. You’ll see a prompt saying:

> “A new MCP server was detected.” → Click **Enable**

Your Playwright MCP is now active in your local Cursor session 🎉

---

### 5. 🧪 Test the Agent

Switch to **Agent Mode** in Cursor, and try a prompt like:

> "Visit cursor.directory and give me 5 examples of MCP servers."

Behind the scenes:

- The LLM decides it needs to use the `browser_navigate` tool.
- It sends a command to the MCP server to open Chrome and browse to the site.
- Chrome launches and loads `cursor.directory`.
- The response (from DOM scraping) is returned to the LLM and shown in your agent panel.

## ⚙️ What’s Happening Behind the Scenes

| Step | Action                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣   | LLM decides a tool call is needed                                   |
| 2️⃣   | MCP client sends the request (via `stdio`) to the Playwright server |
| 3️⃣   | Playwright MCP launches a browser (headless or not)                 |
| 4️⃣   | Navigates to target site and extracts content                       |
| 5️⃣   | Sends structured output back to Cursor and LLM                      |
| 6️⃣   | LLM includes the output in its final response                       |
