**🧠 Intro**

Eden provides a comprehensive view of **MCP servers** — what they expose, how they’re built, how they run, and what the future holds for the **MCP ecosystem**. This lecture is a foundational insight into the **flexibility, power, and scalability** of MCP, touching on both current capabilities and exciting future developments like registries, verification, and evolving agents.

---

**📚 Summary**

- MCP servers are **standardized interfaces** that expose tools, resources, and prompts to AI applications (MCP hosts).
- These servers are modular, allowing developers to **federate access to any external system** (Stripe, weather APIs, databases, etc.).
- MCP servers can be **built manually**, **generated with AI**, or **sourced from the community or vendors**.
- They can run **locally**, **remotely**, or in **containers** and support composability between agents.
- The future of MCP includes **verification**, **centralized registries**, **authentication**, and **agent-level discovery** of new capabilities.

**🗝️ Core Interfaces MCP Servers Expose**

1. **🛠️ Tools**

   - Functions LLMs can invoke (e.g., `getForecast`, `orderFood`).
   - Full developer freedom — can read/write from/to any system.
   - LLMs decide when to invoke based on context.

2. **📁 Resources**

   - Contextual data passed to the LLM.
   - Can be **static** (PDFs, JSON, text) or **dynamic** (fetched API responses in real-time).
   - Gives LLMs access to rich background info.

3. **💬 Prompts**

   - Reusable, template-based interactions.
   - Useful for **standardizing complex conversations** or requests.

**🧱 How to Build MCP Servers**

| Method               | Description                                                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📝 Manual Coding     | Write in Python or Node.js (100–200 lines). Full control.                  |
| 🤖 AI-Generated      | Tools like Cursor or MCP Generator help scaffold quickly.                  |
| 🌍 Community Servers | Thousands available on GitHub. Clone and extend.                           |
| 🏢 Vendor-Maintained | Companies like Stripe and Cloudflare provide official open-source servers. |

> 💡 **Don’t reinvent the wheel**: Always check if a server already exists before building one from scratch.

**🖥️ How MCP Servers Can Be Run**

| Mode                       | Details                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 🖥️ **Local (stdio)**       | CLI-based, used by Cursor and Cloud Desktop. |
| 🌐 **Remote (SSE or SSH)** | For cloud-deployed servers.                  |
| 🐳 **Dockerized**          | Ideal for production deployments.            |

> 🧪 Future course content may include a Docker deployment walkthrough (let Eden know if you want it).

**📤 Extra Capability: Sampling**

- MCP servers can **ask the AI host to complete prompts**.
- Useful for prompting the LLM to generate something mid-process.
- Example: AI application asks the MCP server for a formatted response, and the MCP server uses the LLM itself to fill it in.
- Powerful but comes with **security and privacy risks**.

**🔗 Composability**

- Any AI app or agent can be **both a client and a server**.
- Enables **layered agentic systems**:

  - Specialized agents serve tools to others.
  - Promotes reusability and clean separation of concerns.

**🔮 The Future of MCP**

| Feature                         | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌐 **MCP Registry & Discovery** | Central directory for finding and publishing MCP servers.                                                  |
| ✅ **Server Verification**      | Mitigates **supply chain attacks** by marking official servers.                                            |
| 🤖 **Runtime Tool Discovery**   | Self-evolving agents could discover & integrate new tools at runtime.                                      |
| 🧭 **Web Exposure Standards**   | Websites may adopt `/.well-known/app.json` to expose MCP endpoints (like `robots.txt` for search engines). |
| 🔐 **Authentication Support**   | OAuth 2.0 and session tokens for secure, authorized access.                                                |
| 🔁 **Session Management**       | Tokens will help maintain persistent, secure sessions with servers.                                        |

**💡 Tips & Reminders**

- ✨ Use accurate descriptions for tools and inputs — they drive better LLM behavior.
- 🧠 You can extend official servers if you need more functionality.
- 📦 Clone and modify MCP servers as a starting point.
- ⚠️ Be cautious of unverified community servers — they can pose a security risk.
- 🔄 Composable agents = scalable AI workflows.
