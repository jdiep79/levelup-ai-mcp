**🛠️ Intro**

Ethan introduces **MCP Inspector**, a powerful and interactive developer tool created by **Anthropic**, designed specifically to help **test, debug, and inspect MCP servers**. Whether you're building tools, exposing resources, or defining prompts, MCP Inspector makes the development experience smoother and more transparent.

---

**📚 Summary**

MCP Inspector acts like a **playground and diagnostic dashboard** for MCP servers. It connects to your local or remote MCP server and gives you a full GUI-based interface to:

- Browse and test tools
- View and preview resources
- Interact with prompt templates
- Monitor server logs and notifications

This introduction video is just a high-level overview; future lessons will dive deeper into its powerful features.

**🗝️ Key Features of MCP Inspector**

| Feature                    | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧰 **Tools Tab**           | Lists all tools your server exposes, shows input/output schemas, and allows custom test runs. |
| 📂 **Resources Tab**       | Displays all registered resources, metadata, and enables content previews.                    |
| 💬 **Prompts Tab**         | View prompt templates, placeholders, and test them with dynamic input.                        |
| 📣 **Notifications Panel** | Real-time server logs, responses, and error messages for traceability.                        |
| 🔌 **Connection Support**  | Connects to both **stdio** and **SSH**-based MCP servers.                                     |

**🧪 Example: MCP Inspector in Action**

1. **🔗 Connect to a local server**

   - Ethan connects to a **localhost** MCP server via SSH (not stdio).

2. **🧭 Explore Tools**

   - Server exposes:

     - `listDocumentSources`
     - `fetchDocs`

   - You can:

     - View tool schemas
     - Enter input dynamically
     - Inspect results returned from tool execution

3. **💡 Use Case**:

   - The server being debugged fetches documentation for popular libraries.
   - Demonstrates tool invocation and output parsing inside Inspector.

**✅ Benefits**

| Advantage                        | Why it Matters                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 👁️ Visual tool discovery         | See your tools without digging through code                   |
| 🧪 Instant testability           | Run tools and prompts without restarting your dev environment |
| 🧠 Useful for prompt engineering | Test prompt templates with different variables                |
| ⚠️ Real-time feedback            | See what’s going wrong directly in the logs                   |
| 🔄 No install required           | Can be run via `npm` or remotely                              |

---

**🚀 Getting Started**

1. **Install via npm**

   ```bash
   npx mcp-inspector
   ```

2. **Launch and Connect**

   - Choose between:

     - `stdio` (for local dev servers)
     - `ssh` (for remote servers)

3. **Explore Tabs**

   - Test tools
   - View prompt behavior
   - Inspect resources

---

**💡 Pro Tips**

- When building MCP servers, **use Inspector from Day 1** to iterate faster.
- Especially helpful when your tools fail silently or return strange formats.
- Works great when debugging **schema mismatches**, **prompt errors**, and **tool routing issues**.
