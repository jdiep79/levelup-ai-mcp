## 🧠 MCP Client Setup with LangChain Integration (Stdio Transport)

In this tutorial, Eden sets up an **MCP client** that connects to the previously built **math MCP server** via **stdio transport**. This setup forms the foundation for agentic orchestration using **LangChain’s ReAct agent**.

---

### 🧱 Project Overview

- ✅ Integrates MCP servers into a LangChain-compatible format.
- ✅ Uses `stdio` as the transport layer for local process communication.
- ✅ Prepares for agentic interaction using LangGraph’s ReAct agent.

### 📦 Key Packages & Imports

| Package                                       | Purpose                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mcp.client.ClientSession`                    | Establishes and maintains client/server session           |
| `mcp.client.params.StdioServerParams`         | Configuration for how the MCP server is launched          |
| `mcp.client.stdio.StdioClient`                | Communicates with MCP server via stdin/stdout             |
| `langchain_mcp_adapters.tools.load_mcp_tools` | Converts MCP tools into LangChain-compatible tools        |
| `langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent`       | Prebuilt agent using ReAct pattern for tool orchestration |
| `openai.ChatOpenAI`                           | LLM to handle agent reasoning (supports function calling) |
| `uv` + `aioshort`                             | For environment setup and code quality (import sorting)   |

### 📋 Setup Steps

#### 1. 🧪 Clean Run Check

```bash
uv run main.py
```

Ensures the script is running and environment variables are properly set.

---

#### 2. ✨ MCP Session Setup

```python
from mcp.client import ClientSession
from mcp.client.params import StdioServerParams
```

- `ClientSession` handles the lifecycle and communication.
- `StdioServerParams` defines how to spawn the MCP server (command + args).

---

#### 3. 🔌 Client Definition (for stdin/stdout communication)

```python
from mcp.client.stdio import StdioClient
```

- Communicates with the MCP server through `stdio`.
- Spawns the MCP server as a subprocess.

---

#### 4. 🔄 Tool Transformation

```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters.tools import load_mcp_tools
```

- Converts the raw MCP tool schema into LangChain tools.
- Makes tools compatible with agents like ReAct.

---

#### 5. 🧠 Agent Setup

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from openai import ChatOpenAI
```

- `create_react_agent`: Orchestrates when to call which tools.
- `ChatOpenAI`: Default OpenAI model for reasoning + function calls.

---

### 🛠 Server Parameter Configuration

```python
stdio_server_params = StdioServerParams(
    command="python",
    args=["/absolute/path/to/servers/math_server.py"]
)
```

> ⚠️ Important: Use **absolute path** to the MCP server to avoid errors during subprocess spawning.

You can grab it via:

```bash
pwd
```

---

### 🚀 Execution Flow Summary

1. **Create `stdio_server_params`** to define how to start the MCP server.
2. **Establish a `ClientSession`** using `StdioClient`.
3. **Load MCP tools** using `load_mcp_tools()`.
4. **Use LangGraph’s ReAct agent** to orchestrate tool usage.
5. **Run agent** with user query and see how it leverages the math tools via MCP!

---

### ✅ Sanity Check: Fixing Import Error

```python
# Fix incorrect import:
# ❌ from langchain_mcp_adapters import load_mcp_tools
# ✅
from langchain_mcp_adapters.tools import load_mcp_tools
```

### 📤 Git Commit

Used Cursor’s AI-generated commit feature to push changes to GitHub under the working branch:

```
project/mcp-adapters
```

Now the repo includes:

- `main.py` with MCP client and agent setup
- Necessary imports and configurations

---

### 💡 Pro Tips

- Keep import blocks organized using `aioshort`:

  ```bash
  uv pip install aioshort
  ```

- Make sure your server path is correct and absolute.

- Use `.env` + `python-dotenv` to store API keys securely.

- Install LangChain + OpenAI models that support function calling.
