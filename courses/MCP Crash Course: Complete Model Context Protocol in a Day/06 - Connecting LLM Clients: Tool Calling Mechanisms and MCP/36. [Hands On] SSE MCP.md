## 🔧 Setting Up MCP Servers: Math & Weather Servers

In this section, Eden demonstrates how to create two basic **MCP servers** to later integrate with MCP clients. The focus is on showcasing different **transport mechanisms**: `Stdio` and `SSE (Server-Sent Events)`.

---

### 📁 Project Structure

A new package was introduced:

```
servers/
├── __init__.py           # Makes it a Python package
├── math_server.py        # MCP server using stdio transport
└── weather_server.py     # MCP server using SSE (HTTP) transport
```

---

### ➕ `math_server.py` – Basic Arithmetic via Stdio

🧮 **Purpose**: Provide two simple tools — `add` and `multiply`.

📌 **Transport**: `Stdio` (standard input/output)

#### ✅ Features

- Runs directly from terminal using:

  ```bash
  uv run servers/math_server.py
  ```

- Easy to integrate with local agents or tools.

- Implemented using [LangChain MCP Adapters repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters).

💡 _Tip_: Avoid naming files `math.py` to prevent collision with Python’s standard `math` module.

### 🌡️ `weather_server.py` – Static Weather Report via SSE

☀️ **Purpose**: Always returns `"It's hot as hell"` regardless of query.

📌 **Transport**: `SSE (Server-Sent Events)` over HTTP

#### ✅ Features

- Communication is HTTP-based.

- Runs a server at `http://localhost:8000`:

  ```bash
  uv run servers/weather_server.py
  ```

- Easily scalable and externally callable.

📎 You can change the default port via the MCP SDK config.

🔧 **Command Output Example**:

```
🚀 MCP server listening on http://localhost:8000
```

### ⚙️ Transport Comparison

| Feature                | Math Server          | Weather Server             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Tool Type**          | Arithmetic tools     | Static weather response    |
| **Transport Protocol** | `Stdio`              | `SSE (Server-Sent Events)` |
| **Execution Context**  | CLI/local            | HTTP endpoint              |
| **Flexibility**        | Dev-friendly, simple | Scalable, decoupled        |

---

### ✅ Git Integration

- Tracked and committed changes using Cursor AI commit generation:

  ```bash
  git add servers/
  git commit -m "Add math and weather MCP servers"
  git push
  ```

- Now visible in GitHub under the new project branch with two commits:

  1. Project boilerplate
  2. Added math and weather servers

---

### 🧠 Summary

- Created two foundational MCP servers with different transports.
- `math_server.py` uses `Stdio` — great for local dev and simplicity.
- `weather_server.py` introduces `SSE` for HTTP-based communication — ideal for remote agents and scaling.
- Ready for integration with MCP clients in upcoming steps. 🎯
