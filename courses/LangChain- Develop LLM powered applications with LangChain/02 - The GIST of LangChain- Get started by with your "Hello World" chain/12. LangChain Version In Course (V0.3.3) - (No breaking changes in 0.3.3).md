## 📦 LangChain Versions & Compatibility in the Course

---

### 🧠 **Intro**

LangChain is a rapidly evolving framework, and staying in sync with the correct version is important to avoid unexpected bugs or missing features. Eden clarifies the version used in the course and what you should know if you're using a newer one.

---

### 📝 **Summary**

- The course is developed using **LangChain v0.3.3**
- This is the latest version _at the time of recording_
- You can check the version in the `Pipfile.lock`
- **Semantic versioning** applies: patch versions are safe, but major changes may introduce breaking changes
- The instructor actively updates course material when breaking changes occur 🚧

### 🔍 How to Check Your LangChain Version

1. Look in your `Pipfile.lock`:

   ```json
   "langchain": {
     "version": "==0.3.3",
     ...
   }
   ```

2. Or check via CLI:

   ```bash
   pipenv run pip show langchain
   ```

### 🔢 Understanding Semantic Versioning

| Version Format      | Meaning                                | Emoji |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` | Semantic Versioning                    | 🔢    |
| `0.3.3 → 0.3.7`     | Patch → Safe to update                 | ✅    |
| `0.3.x → 0.4.0`     | Minor bump → Likely safe               | ⚠️    |
| `0.x → 1.0.0`       | Major bump → Breaking changes possible | ❗    |

- 🧪 Patch versions include bug fixes and non-breaking features.
- 🔧 Minor updates may include small enhancements.
- 💥 Major changes may require code refactoring.

### 🆘 What to Do If Things Break

- 💬 Ping Eden in the **Discord channel** if you run into incompatibility issues.
- 🔁 He updates the course as soon as **breaking changes** are introduced.
- 🔒 Stick to **0.3.3** for full compatibility unless you’re comfortable debugging!

---

### 🧑‍💻 Best Practice Tip

To ensure stability:

```bash
pipenv install langchain==0.3.3
```

This will lock you into the same version used in the course, ensuring everything works _as shown in the videos_ 🎥

### ✅ Final Takeaway

LangChain updates frequently — but thanks to semantic versioning, you’re safe sticking with version 0.3.3 or higher **within the same minor release**. If something breaks, Eden has your back on Discord 💪📬
