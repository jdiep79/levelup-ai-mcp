## 💻 LangChain Project Setup in VS Code — Complete Guide

---

### 🧠 **Intro**

This section guides you through setting up your **LangChain project in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. Although the instructor uses PyCharm for the rest of the course, this special walkthrough ensures VS Code users are fully equipped to follow along. The IDE doesn't matter — what's important is getting your environment ready to run and debug LangChain applications!

---

### 📝 **Summary**

By the end of this walkthrough, you'll:

- ✅ Clone the correct starter branch
- ✅ Set up your **Pipenv** virtual environment
- ✅ Install required LangChain packages modularly
- ✅ Configure **VS Code** to use your `.env` file and interpreter
- ✅ Create and test your first LangChain file (`icebreaker.py`)
- ✅ Optionally install the `black` code formatter

You’ll be ready to jump into building LLM-powered applications!

### 🧩 **Step-by-Step Setup for VS Code**

#### 1️⃣ Clone the Starter Branch

```bash
git clone -b 1-start-here <repo-url>
```

- Replace `<repo-url>` with the GitHub repo URL.
- Confirm you're on the correct branch.

#### 2️⃣ Open the Folder in VS Code

- Launch VS Code.
- Open the cloned folder: `File > Open Folder`.

#### 3️⃣ Create Pipenv Shell

```bash
pipenv shell
```

- This creates a new virtual environment.
- A `Pipfile` and virtualenv will be generated.

#### 4️⃣ Install Required Packages

```bash
pipenv install langchain
pipenv install langchain-openai
pipenv install langchain-community
pipenv install langchainhub
```

#### 📦 Why Modular Packages?

LangChain refactored to avoid vendor bloat. You only install what you use:

- `langchain`: Core framework 🧠
- `langchain-openai`: OpenAI tools (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) 🔗
- `langchain-community`: Utilities (text splitters, parsers) 🛠️
- `langchainhub`: Download community-contributed prompts 📚

---

### 🧪 Create a Simple Script

#### 5️⃣ New File: `icebreaker.py`

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello LangChain!")
```

#### 6️⃣ Set Python Interpreter in VS Code

- Press `Cmd+Shift+P` → “Python: Select Interpreter”
- Choose the Pipenv environment (look for suffix like `...-sjt`)
- Verify in bottom-right corner: Python 3.11 from the right env 🐍

#### 7️⃣ Run the Script

- Click the ▶️ (Play) button in the top-right.
- You should see `Hello LangChain!` printed in the terminal.

---

### 🔐 Environment Variables Setup

#### 8️⃣ Create `.env` File

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="dummy_api_key"
```

> 📝 Replace with your actual key later. This is just for setup testing.

#### 9️⃣ Create `launch.json`

- In the Run & Debug panel (🪲), click "create a launch.json file"
- Choose "Python File"

Update your `launch.json` to include:

```json
{
  "name": "Icebreaker Runner",
  "type": "python",
  "request": "launch",
  "program": "${file}",
  "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
}
```

Now VS Code will auto-load environment variables from `.env` when running!

---

### 🔍 Test Environment Variable in Code

Update `icebreaker.py`:

```python
import os

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello LangChain!")
    print("API KEY:", os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```

▶️ Run again — you should see your dummy API key printed.

🛑 Set a breakpoint and run in debug mode to verify debugging works too.

---

### 🧼 Install Code Formatter (Optional)

Install `black`:

```bash
pipenv install black
```

Format code:

```bash
black .
```

Code is now clean and PEP8-compliant 🎨

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----- |
| **Pipenv**              | Virtualenv + dependency manager         | 🐍    |
| **LangChain**           | Core framework                          | 🧠    |
| **langchain-openai**    | OpenAI LLM integrations                 | 🔗    |
| **langchain-community** | Tools/utilities like splitters, parsers | 🛠️    |
| **langchainhub**        | Dynamic access to public prompts        | 📚    |
| **.env**                | Manage secrets/config                   | 🔐    |
| **launch.json**         | Run + debug configs                     | 🐞    |

### 💡 Pro Tips

- You can **switch IDEs anytime** — logic and setup remain the same.
- `launch.json` helps you set custom runners, environments, and debuggers.
- `black` ensures you keep code clean — but it's optional.

### ✅ Final Setup Checklist

✅ Repo cloned
✅ Virtualenv created via Pipenv
✅ LangChain packages installed modularly
✅ `icebreaker.py` running successfully
✅ Environment variables loaded from `.env`
✅ VS Code fully debug/run ready

---

### 🚀 You're Ready!

🎉 You now have a fully configured LangChain project in **VS Code**.
Start building LLM-powered apps confidently and follow along with the rest of the course!

🔁 Reminder: Eden continues using PyCharm, but VS Code setup is 100% compatible.
