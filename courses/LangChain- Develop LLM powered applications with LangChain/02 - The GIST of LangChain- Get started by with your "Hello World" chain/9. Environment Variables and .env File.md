## 🔐 Managing Environment Variables with `.env` and `python-dotenv`

---

### 🧠 **Intro**

Before diving deeper into the course, the instructor addresses a common issue many students faced: **environment variable setup**. This segment introduces a clean, reliable solution — using a `.env` file and the `python-dotenv` package — to ensure your variables are properly loaded every time you run your LangChain code.

---

### 📝 **Summary**

- All environment variables (like API keys) will be managed inside a `.env` file.
- You'll use the `python-dotenv` package to load these variables automatically.
- The course repo includes a `.env.example` file for reference.
- You should manually rename it to `.env` and **fill in your own values** when instructed.
- This avoids hardcoding secrets in your scripts and ensures consistency across environments.

---

### 🪜 **Step-by-Step Setup**

#### 1️⃣ Create a `.env` File

```env
COOL_API_KEY=some-value
```

- This file will store your API keys and config secrets.
- Never commit this file to version control (add it to `.gitignore`).

#### 2️⃣ Install `python-dotenv`

```bash
pipenv install python-dotenv
```

📦 This package loads `.env` variables into `os.environ`.

#### 3️⃣ Use It in Your Code

Update `icebreaker.py`:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()  # Load variables from .env

print("API Key:", os.environ["COOL_API_KEY"])
```

▶️ When you run the script, it should print:

```
API Key: some-value
```

### 🧾 `.env.example` File

- Included in the course repo as a reference template.
- **What to do with it**:

  1. Copy or rename it:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

  2. Fill in **real API values** as the course progresses.

⚠️ Do **not** populate everything at once — only when instructed during relevant lessons.
