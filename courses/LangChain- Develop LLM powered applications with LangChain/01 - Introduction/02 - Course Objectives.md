## 🎯 Course Intro: LangChain for LLM-Powered Applications

---

### 🧠 **Intro**

This LangChain course sets out to transform software engineers and data scientists into confident builders of LLM-powered applications — particularly **Agents** and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** apps. The instructor makes it clear: this is a **hands-on, deep-dive course** into the LangChain ecosystem, tailored for people with coding experience (especially in Python), but no need for prior ML knowledge 🚫🤖.

### 📝 **Summary**

- Goal: Build production-ready LLM apps using LangChain.
- Coverage: LangChain, RAG, Agents, LangSmith, LangGraph, and real-world software practices.
- Target Audience: Software engineers, data scientists (but also open to other curious minds).
- Prerequisites: Python, Git, virtual environments — basic dev skills only.
- Refund Policy: 30-day no-questions-asked 💸✅
