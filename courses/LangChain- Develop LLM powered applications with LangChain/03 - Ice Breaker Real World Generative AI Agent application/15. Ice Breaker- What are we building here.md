## ❄️ Icebreaker Project Overview — Let’s Build with LangChain

---

### 🧠 **Intro**

In this segment, Eden kicks off the **Icebreaker application** — the first full project in the course. This isn’t just a demo — it’s a real-world LLM app that will teach you many **core LangChain features** through hands-on implementation.

### 📝 **Project Summary: Icebreaker App**

The **Icebreaker app** will:

1. Accept a **name** as input 🧑
2. Search for that person’s **Twitter** & **LinkedIn** profiles 🐦🔗
3. Extract relevant bio and profile information 🔍
4. Use an LLM to generate:

   - A natural, conversation-starting **icebreaker**
   - A small **summary** of the person for context 💬

| Feature            | Purpose                                            | Emoji |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| **Chains**         | Connect multi-step workflows                       | ⛓️    |
| **Agents**         | Let the LLM reason & decide what tool to use       | 🧠    |
| **Custom Agents**  | Your own logic + tool integrations                 | 🧩    |
| **Tools**          | Plugins for web search, APIs, etc.                 | 🛠️    |

This project forms the **foundation** for later apps — like the **Code Interpreter**, **Doc Assistant**, and more.
